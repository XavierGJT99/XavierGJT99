## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a student pursuing a degree in data science and business analytics in UOL

This is a project that I am working on in my free time which is a streamlit app that allow users to do a variety of things when a pdf is uploaded into the app.
The current version has functions like text extraction, summarise text, extract entities, extract images as well as a regex search function.

I am planning to add on more functions such as extracting tables, image recognition, and more.
